# dwm

My awesome dwm build.

## About
This build works best with the whole software suite deployed by [my autoconfig script](https://github.com/houman-rzk/autoconfig).

It uses vim-like keybindings for navigation and many other intuitive program-launching keybindings.

Comes with the best selection of tiling layouts.

Supports pywal and emojis.
